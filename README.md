## üìñ About

This project is an educational tool designed to help students and beginners understand:
- How firewalls filter network traffic
- The difference between TCP and UDP protocols
- Common network ports and their services
- Real-time logging and monitoring concepts
- Default deny vs. default allow security policies

## üöÄ Features
